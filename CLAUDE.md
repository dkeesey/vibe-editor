# Vibe-Editor

> **Scope:** CMS pilot - git-native WYSIWYG for Astro sites
> **Status:** Pre-alpha, vetting phase

## What Is This?

Click-to-edit content system using MDX frontmatter (microtext). Clients edit text where it appears, changes write to git-tracked files.

**One-line:** "Text editing as a solved problem so it's never your problem again."

## Key Files

- `VISION-NOTES-2026-01-20.md` - Strategic positioning session notes
- `.claude/bundles/strategic-positioning.md` - Extracted learnings bundle

## Bundles

```bash
# Strategic positioning and value prop framing
cat /Users/deankeesey/Workspace/vibe-editor/.claude/bundles/strategic-positioning.md
```

## Current Status (2026-01-20)

**Phase:** Vetting (Step 2 of: Solve -> Vet -> Share -> Known)

**What exists:**
- Vision document with honest framing
- Strategic positioning bundle

**What's needed:**
- Actual implementation
- Test with 2-3 client sites
- Verify clients use self-serve editing
- Test MCP integration for client AI

## Anti-Patterns

1. **Don't oversell:** "Paradigm shift" -> No, it's incremental improvement that removes friction
2. **Don't skip vetting:** Ideas are cheap, proven tools are valuable
3. **Don't optimize for sophisticated AI:** The value is for dumber models (client chatbots) that need safe boundaries

## Running Memory

### 2026-01-20
- Initial strategic positioning session
- Created `VISION-NOTES-2026-01-20.md` with full exploration
- Extracted `strategic-positioning.md` bundle with honest framing
- Key insight: Simple value props beat elaborate ones
